Here are some battle tips: Use status-boosting moves like swordsdance, calmmind, dragondance, nastyplot strategically. The boosting will be reset when pokemon switch out. Set traps like stickyweb, spikes, toxicspikes, stealthrock strategically. When face to a opponent is boosting or has already boosted its attack/special attack/speed, knock it out as soon as possible, even sacrificing your pokemon. if choose to switch, you forfeit to take a move this turn and the opposing pokemon will definitely move first. Therefore, you should pay attention to speed, type-resistance and defense of your switch-in pokemon to bear the damage from the opposing pokemon. And If the switch-in pokemon has a slower speed then the opposing pokemon, the opposing pokemon will move twice continuously.", "user_prompt": "Historical turns:\nTurn 6: opposing Seismitoad used Weather Ball.
